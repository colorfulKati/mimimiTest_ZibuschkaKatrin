# Katrin-Anna Zibuschka - Eignungstest Mimimi

Task 1 - daWindci
  For this task I recreated level 1-7 from daWindci.
  Wind can be created using the mouse, similar to using a touchscreen, in a straight line.
  
Task 2 - Volcano
  Rocks can be spawned by pressing [space] on the keyboard and clicking the UI button in the upper right corner of the screen.
  
Task 3 - Sumo Dancing
  This game is a local multiplayer in which 2 players compete in being the fastest and most precise dancers in the whole town.
  By completing a series of dance moves, the slime on the opponent's side of the screen spreads.
  May the best dancer win!
  Controls:
  * Player 1 (blue dancer): W-A-S-D (Up-Left-Down-Right)
  * Player 2 (red dancer): arrow keys
